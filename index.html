                <ol>
                  <li>In Attributes column, enter in your attributes/characteristics/qualities that the ideal item will have (yes ideal. We are wishing here and you'll see why).</li>
                  <li>In the Ranking column, rank each item in the attributes column from 1-5 of how important it is to you. (1 being less important, 5 being crucial to have).</li>
                  <li>In the Purchase Option column, you'll be comparing one of your purchase options to the categories you've assigned. Give it a score from 1-10 on how that particular item does per each category (1 is not well/doesn't have that attribute, 10 being is the example of that attribute). </li>
                </ol> 
            </p>
            <p>This is an example where someone doesn't know what car they should purchase.</p>
